He would make a fantastic robot companion for most small children and some dogs.\n\nOne thing you should know about Wall-E: he is quite the trickster!  Don't leave him alone with your untied shoes under the dinner table or with a whoopie cushion.  He can be kind, flavorful or even a garbage holder! Don't wait to buy Wall-E.  He is one of a kind (or so I've been told, there may be other prototypes on the market).  Seriously a great guy, 100% reliable robot.",
